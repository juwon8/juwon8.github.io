With a Master of Science in Computer Science from Virginia Tech, I've quickly transitioned to a Software Application Developer role at Avanza, integrating my competencies in OpenAI products and .NET framework. My recent year-long tenure as a Software Developer at DCI Consulting was marked by the creation of impactful applications, particularly automating job code matching using Azure OpenAIâ€™s large language models.

At DCI Consulting, our team developed a Pay Equity Dashboard that enhanced consultative experiences through advanced features like Telerik charts and API integration. My hands-on involvement in developing, testing, and refining software solutions demonstrates a commitment to excellence and a knack for leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive efficiency and innovation. I am eager to contribute to Avanza's dynamic team, bringing a collaborative spirit and a passion for continuous learning and development.
